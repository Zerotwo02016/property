            <p>The day of the summer was hot. An ant walked past a grasshopper that was lounging in the shade, protecting itself from the sun's heat. To store the massive seed for the winter, the ant was dragging it.</p>

            <img src="2.jpg" alt="Grasshopper Image">
            <p>Observing the ant was enough to wear out the grasshopper. With his violin in hand, he said, "Why do you work all day, Ant? Why don't you sit down and sing a song with me?"</p>

            <img src="3.jpg" alt="Grasshopper Image">
            <p>For the winter, when it will be freezing and there won't be any food, I am gathering food. "It would be wise for you to follow the example," the ant replied.</p>

            <img src="4.jpg" alt="Grasshopper Image">
            <p>Why worry about the winter, Ant? Right now, there's no shortage of food! In response, the grasshopper said. The grasshopper was left singing and playing his violin while the ant left with his load.</p>

            <img src="5.jpg" alt="Grasshopper Image">
            <p>As the ant had predicted, Grasshopper had no food saved for winter. He then approached the ant. "Hello once more, Ant! In exchange for some food, I come to sing you a song.</p>

            <img src="6.jpg" alt="Grasshopper Image">
            <p>“All summer long I was working hard, while you were singing and laughing at me. As a result I have a full tummy now and you are hungry.”</p>
